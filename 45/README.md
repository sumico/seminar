Here is an English translation (summary) of the “Research on Environment and Health”.

Overview of the research on environment and health

When we hear “environment,” many people tend to think of global issues like climate change or air pollution. However, my focus is on the more immediate, everyday “environment” around us — namely, the urban and residential environment in which we live. I examine how these local environments relate to health. 

In particular, I approach the issue of obesity from the perspective of urban environment improvement. I hypothesize that the built environment and the “food environment” (i.e. accessibility and quality of food) shape our opportunities to incorporate physical activity — especially walking — into daily life, thereby influencing body weight and health.

One key concept I use is **walkability** (i.e. how walkable a city is). A “walkable” environment encourages people to walk more in their daily routines. I propose that environments with high walkability will support higher levels of physical activity, which in turn contribute to preventing or reducing obesity. 

I analyze what makes a city walkable. Three major factors (sometimes called the “3D’s” of walkability) are:

Population density — many people in an area make walking destinations closer.

Pedestrian-friendly street design — safe, comfortable, and well‐designed streets encourage walking.

Diversity of land use — having many kinds of destinations (shops, services, residential, green spaces) close by reduces the need to travel far.
I examine how these factors are associated with body weight outcomes and health. 

To test the hypothesis that a walkable environment supports healthier weight, I conduct empirical analyses: comparing existing cities, investigating residents’ health outcomes relative to features of their neighborhoods, controlling for confounding variables, and looking for statistical evidence. 

In applying this research, the goal is not just to show correlation but to provide evidence to guide urban planning and design — i.e. how one might intentionally shape the built environment to promote healthier lifestyles at the population level.
